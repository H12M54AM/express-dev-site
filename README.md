# express-dev-site

I want to work with Express in Web development, however, I will first learn how to use it and show my works as well as incredably detailed documentation in the README file for future references and to help someone going through the same thing as me. 

This is a simple website with the basics in what you would expect and I am just going to insert very commonly added things in a normal website owned by a company but many since it is just inspiration to help me with designing and documenting the process. 

## Getting Started
